/*
    You are needed to transfer important data. So your goal is to maximize the amount of data transferred. 
    Given a list of memory block sizes and a maximum capacity, choose the blocks to maximize the transferred data while not exceeding the capacity.

    Input:
    A list of integers representing memory block sizes.
    An integer capacity, the maximum size that can be transferred.

    Output:
    An integer representing the maximum sum of memory block sizes that can be transferred.

    Example
    Input
    memory_blocks = [2, 3, 5, 7, 1]
    capacity = 10

    Output
    10

    [You can transfer blocks of size 2, 3, and 5 for a total of 10]
