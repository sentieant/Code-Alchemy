/*
The memory vault has experienced fragmentation, causing different sections to overlap. Your task is to merge overlapping memory intervals to consolidate the memory blocks.

Given a set of intervals representing memory blocks (each interval has a start and end time), merge all overlapping intervals and return the list of non-overlapping intervals.

Input:
A list of intervals where each interval is represented as [start, end].

Output:
A list of merged, non-overlapping intervals.

Example:
Input
memory_blocks = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7], [6, 8]]

Output
[[1, 4], [5, 8]]
