/*
The systemâ€™s file storage is compromised by malware. Certain combinations of file names across different directories may form words or patterns that represent malware streams. 
Your task is to detect these malware-infected combinations by searching through a list of filenames. 
If any combination of the given filenames forms a word in the malware list, those files are considered corrupted.

You need to check all possible combinations of filenames and determine if any combination matches a word in the malware list. 
If such a combination exists, mark those files as corrupted.

Task:
- Given a list of filenames in the system.
- Given a malware list that contains certain words, each representing a malware stream.
- Find all combinations of filenames that, when concatenated in any order, form a word from the malware list.
- If a combination forms a malware word, return those filenames as corrupted.

Input:
A list of filenames[] that represent the file names in the system.
A list of malwareWords[] containing words or patterns that represent malware streams.

Output:
A list of corrupted filenames that form a malware word. If no such combination exists, return "No corrupted files".
