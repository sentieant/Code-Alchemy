/*
    The system's resources are vulnerable to malware attacks, and critical data needs to be transferred in priority order to ensure protection. 
    Your task is to create a min-heap to manage the transfer of critical data. Each entry in the heap will consist of a priority level and a data name. 
    Lower priority numbers indicate higher urgency for transfer.

    Implement a min-heap-based solution to prioritize the transfer of critical data based on their priority levels. 
    The min-heap is essential because it allows for easy verification of the highest priority data before final transfer, ensuring that the most critical data is safe from corruption.

    Additionally, implement a deletion functionality to remove data entries from the min-heap. This can be useful for managing data that is no longer critical or has already been transferred.

    Input:
    A 2D array/vector where each entry contains the following:
    - An integer representing the priority level (lower numbers indicate higher priority)
    - A string representing the name of the data to be transferred

    Example input:
    data_entries = [
        [3, "system_backup"],
        [1, "user_data"],
        [5, "temporary_files"],
        [4, "logs"],
        [2, "config_backup"],
        [6, "app_data"],
        [7, "database_snapshot"],
        [1, "email_archives"],
        [0, "critical_system_files"],
        [8, "cache"]
    ]

    Expected Operations:
    - Add entries to the min-heap.
    - Display the contents of the min-heap to show the priority order.
    - Implement a deletion function to remove a specific entry from the min-heap based on its data name.

    Example Output:
    Min-Heap:
    [
        (0, "critical_system_files"),
        (1, "user_data"),
        (1, "email_archives"),
        (2, "config_backup"),
        (3, "system_backup"),
        (5, "temporary_files"),
        (6, "app_data"),
        (4, "logs"),
        (7, "database_snapshot"),
        (8, "cache")
    ]

    Deleting entry: temporary_files      // input 

    Min-Heap after deletion:
    [
        (0, "critical_system_files"),
        (1, "user_data"),
        (1, "email_archives"),
        (2, "config_backup"),
        (3, "system_backup"),
        (4, "logs"),
        (6, "app_data"),
        (7, "database_snapshot"),
        (8, "cache")
    ]
