/*
    Matrix Multiplication Challenge: Optimize Matrix Processing
    In the core, you need to process matrices representing different states of a system. 
    These matrices need to be multiplied frequently, and the operations must be optimized for better CPU performance.

    Problem Statement:
    You are given two matrices A and B. Implement an efficient algorithm to multiply them and output the resultant matrix.

    Input:
    Two matrices A and B of compatible dimensions.

    Output:
    The resultant matrix after multiplying A and B.

    Example
    Input
    A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

    Output
    [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
