/*
    Certain parts of the Matrix Nexus require reconfiguration to optimize parallel data processing. Your task is to transpose the given matrix to ensure smooth data flow.

    Task:
    Given an n x m matrix, return its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns.

    Input:
    An integer matrix grid of size n x m.
    Output:
    The transposed matrix.

    Example:
    Input:
    grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
    ]
    Output:
    [
    [1, 4],
    [2, 5],
    [3, 6]
    ]
