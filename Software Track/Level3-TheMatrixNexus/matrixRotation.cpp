/*
    Data within the Matrix Nexus is misaligned, leading to inefficient data processing. Your task is to re-align the data by rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise to restore order.

    Task:
    Given an n x n matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise in place.

    Input:
    A square matrix grid of size n x n.
    Output:
    The rotated matrix.

    Example:
    Input:
    grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
    ]

    Output:
    [
    [7, 4, 1],
    [8, 5, 2],
    [9, 6, 3]
    ]
